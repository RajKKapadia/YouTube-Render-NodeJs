# Heroku Alternative
Hey everyone, `Heroku`, "a-popular-easy-to-deploy-your-web-application-service" has announced that they will shut down their free products from [28th November 2022](https://help.heroku.com/RSBRUH58/removal-of-heroku-free-product-plans-faq), whihc is a kind of heart breaking for many hobbiest and freelancer who rely on Heroku for their demos.

I have a good alternative for `Heroku`... called `Render`, you can get more information on it [here](https://render.com/).

It is kind of replica of `Heroku` in almost all the ways, they have even easy to deploy functinality than `Heroku`.

## What you need
* an active [GitHub]() account
* `Git` installed on your local system
* VS Code to use GitHub
* [Render](https://render.com/) account

## How to use this
[Here]() is a small explaination video on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOT01XvBSj12xQsANtTeAcQ).

* go to your `Render` dashboard, select a webservice
* give a name to your service, this will be a part of your public url
* check the settings, specially `run` command
